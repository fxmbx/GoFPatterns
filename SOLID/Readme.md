### SOLID Design Principles

## S - Single Responsibilty Principle specifies that any class should have just a single reason to change. i.e a class should have only one job

this most times results in seperation of concerns

## O - Open-Closed Principle specifies that Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification i.e no class editing should be going on. help eliminate redundancy in code

promote inheritance, interfaces and creating generic objects

## L-Liskov Substituition Principle

## I-Interface Segregation Principle

## D-Dependency Inversion Principle
