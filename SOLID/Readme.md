### SOLID Design Principles

## S - Single Responsibilty Principle specifies that any class should have just a single reason to change. i.e a class should have only one job

this most times results in seperation of concerns

## O - Open-Closed Principle specifies that Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification i.e no class editing should be going on. help eliminate redundancy in code

promote inheritance, interfaces and creating generic objects

## L-Liskov Substituition Principle specifies that every derived class should be substitutable for their parent class

## I-Interface Segregation Principle specifies that a client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use.

Interface seperation of concerns so classes don't enforce methods they dont need by force

## D-Dependency Inversion Principle
